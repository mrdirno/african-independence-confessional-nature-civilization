## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a modern character must interpret a warning or message from the natural world (a specific tree, river, rock formation) that contradicts official maps or data.
- Create a journal entry from the perspective of Kwame's father, Nana Kofi Mensah, on the night of Independence, detailing not public hope, but a private, ecological foreboding.
- Imagine a confrontation between Agyei and a foreign mining or agricultural surveyor. Write the dialogue where Agyei 'translates' what the land is saying about the proposed project.
- Draft a myth or folktale, set in Aduana's past, that explains the origin of the Sankofa stone and its purpose as a living record.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Aduana and its surroundings where geographic features (streams, trees, stones) reveal layers of narrative—historical, personal, ecological—when clicked, visualizing the land as a palimpsest.
- Design a 'Whisper Engine' text generator that takes a seed phrase (e.g., 'the cage was made of our own bones') and generates prose in the novel's lyrical, nature-imbued style, trained on its descriptive passages.
